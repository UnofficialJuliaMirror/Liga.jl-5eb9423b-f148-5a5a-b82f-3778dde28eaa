# LIGA

## Library for Geometric Algebra (Version 0.1.3)


This page is devoted to document and make easier the use of LIGA- Library for 
Geometric Algebra. Our intent is provide a good experience of use for students 
and reseachers interesting in use (and programming) a Geometric Algebra 
framework. All scripts were made in [Julia language](www.julialang.org), 
version 0.6. 

There is a miscellany of libraries for GA study. Our intent here is not to provide software to compete with such libraries in performance or generality. Our goal is to provide a relatively simple, open, easy to install and focused environment for Julia users.

It's important a previous contact with Geometric Algebra in theoretical aspects.
 In this sense, we recommend the following references:

-Christian Perwass, *Geometric Algebra with Applications in Engineering*, 
Springer Series in Geometry and Computing, 2009.

-Valter Soares Camargo, *Conformal Geometric Algebra and Distance Geometry*, (Doctoral Thesis).
IMECC-UNICAMP, 2015. 


## Current Status

The current status of this project is beta quality, don't use for anything important. We can provide some multi-dimensional spaces but without visualization of elements (it is a goal feature for future).

## Developed by

This project was developed as part of master degree dissertation of Vinicius Riter. The main contributors of this work are

* Vinicius Riter
* Emerson Vitor Castelani
* Jair da Silva
* Wesley Shirabayashi
* Valter Soares Camargo
